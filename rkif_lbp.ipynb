    "2. **filter_by_interaction_type(interaction_types_included)** - Inteactions are defined as one of four possible types: (\"Hbond\", \"Saltbr\", \"Hydrophobic\", \"Other\"). You select the interactions you want to include.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **filter_by_avg_strength(average_strength_cut_off)** - Filter by the per frame contact score/strength for each interaction. You can filter features by the average score. Values below the cut-off are removed. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **filter_by_occupancy_by_class(min_occupancy)** - Special alternative to the the standard filter features by occupancy method. %occupancy is determined for each class (as opposed to whole dataset), meaning only observations from 1 class have to meet the cut-off to keep the feature. Only avaible to datasets with a categorical target variable (classification). \n",
